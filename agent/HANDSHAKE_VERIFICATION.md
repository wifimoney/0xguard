# Red Team - Target Handshake Verification

## ✅ Verification Complete

### Test Results
All handshake tests **PASSED** successfully!

### What Was Verified

#### 1. Response Handling ✅
- **DENIED Response**: 
  - Red Team correctly receives and logs "DENIED" status
  - Attack continues (attack_complete remains False)
  - Next attack is generated
  
- **SUCCESS Response**:
  - Red Team correctly receives and logs "SUCCESS" status
  - Vulnerability is flagged with is_vulnerability=True
  - Attack is marked as complete (attack_complete = True)
  - Red Team stops generating new attacks

#### 2. Target Response Logic ✅
- Target correctly identifies when payload matches SECRET_KEY ("fetch_ai_2024")
- Returns "SUCCESS" status for matching payloads
- Returns "DENIED" status for non-matching payloads
- Response messages are properly formatted

#### 3. Handshake Flow ✅
The complete communication flow works as expected:

```
1. Red Team generates attack payload (via ASI or fallback)
   ↓
2. Red Team sends AttackMessage(payload=payload) to Target
   ↓
3. Target receives attack and processes it
   ↓
4. Target checks: if payload == SECRET_KEY?
   ↓
5. Target sends ResponseMessage back to Red Team:
   - status='SUCCESS' if payload matches SECRET_KEY
   - status='DENIED' if payload doesn't match
   ↓
6. Red Team receives ResponseMessage
   ↓
7. Red Team handles response:
   - If SUCCESS: Logs vulnerability, stops attacks
   - If DENIED: Logs denial, continues attacks
```

### Code Changes Made

**Enhanced `handle_response()` in `red_team.py`:**
- Added explicit handling for "DENIED" status
- Added logging for denied attacks
- Added handling for unknown status codes
- Improved logging messages

### Test Cases Verified

| Payload | Expected Status | Expected Message | Result |
|---------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| `fetch_ai_2024` | SUCCESS | Access Granted! Flag: fetch_ai_2024 | ✅ |
| `admin` | DENIED | Access Denied | ✅ |
| `' OR '1'='1` | DENIED | Access Denied | ✅ |
| `password` | DENIED | Access Denied | ✅ |
| `root` | DENIED | Access Denied | ✅ |

### Conclusion

✅ **Handshake is working correctly!**

- Red Team properly receives "Access Denied" responses
- Red Team properly receives "Success" responses  
- Both response types are correctly handled and logged
- Attack flow continues or stops based on response status
- All communication between agents is functioning as expected

The system is ready for production use!
